  To start, Arcane is an animated series adaptation from a video game, League of Legends (which I also play). I'm actually getting excited writing this because the season 2 just came out this week, and so far, it's a banger! I can't express my thoughts about the past episodes any better because of the overwhelming stories being told. Not to mention the quality of script writing and the animations are superb, production really cooked on this one. The past episodes are heavy drama, some characters are starting to pass away, and things are getting **bloodier and intense**. What I actually like, is the fact that the series, Arcane, is getting the recognition it deserves. It's already one of the most watched series on Netflix and considered as one the most expensive animated series up to this day. :smiley: :smiley: :smiley:
